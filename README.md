# Rails MVC Tutorial 2

## Purpose
The purpose of this tutorial is to analyze the Model/View/Controller architecture by analyzing the Rails Tutorial Toy App. It's slightly more complex than the app in the previous tutorial, because this app includes associations.

## Prerequisites
* You should have completed Rails MVC Tutorial 1.
* You should have a Docker container based on my current rbenv-general Docker image.  More details are on the [Ruby on Racetracks](http://www.rubyonracetracks.com) web site.
